# Bulkrax
Bulkrax is a batteries included importer for Samvera applications. It currently includes support for OAI-PMH (DC and Qualified DC) and CSV out of the box. It is also designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily add new importers in to your application or to include them with other gems. Bulkrax provides a full admin interface including creating, editing, scheduling and reviewing imports.

## Installation

### Install Generator

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bulkrax'
# or if using from github
gem 'bulkrax', git: 'https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax.git', branch: 'main'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ rails generate bulkrax:install
```

If using Sidekiq, set up queues for `import` and `export`.

### Manual Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bulkrax'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

Mount the engine in your routes file

```ruby
mount Bulkrax::Engine, at: '/'
```

If using Sidekiq, set up queues for `import` and `export`.

```ruby
# in config/sidekiq.yml
:queues:
  - default
  - import # added
  - export # added
  # your other queues ...
```

```ruby
# in app/assets/javascripts/application.js - before //= require_tree .
//= require bulkrax/application
```

```ruby
# in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css - before *= require_self
*= require 'bulkrax/application'
```

You'll want to add an intializer to configure the importer to your needs:

```ruby
# config/initializers/bulkrax.rb
Bulkrax.setup do |config|
  # some configuration
end
```

The [configuration guide](https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax/wiki/Configuration) provides detailed instructions on the various available configurations.

Example:

```
Bulkrax.setup do | config |
  # If the work type isn't provided during import, use Image
  config.default_work_type = 'Image'

  # Setup a field mapping for the OaiDcParser
  # Your application metadata fields are the key
  #   from: fields in the incoming source data
  config.field_mappings = {
    "Bulkrax::OaiDcParser" => {
      "contributor" => { from: ["contributor"] },
      "creator" => { from: ["creator"] },
      "date_created" => { from: ["date"] },
      "description" => { from: ["description"] },
      "identifier" => { from: ["identifier"] },
      "language" => { from: ["language"], parsed: true },
      "publisher" => { from: ["publisher"] },
      "related_url" => { from: ["relation"] },
      "rights_statement" => { from: ["rights"] },
      "source" => { from: ["source"], source_identifier: true },
      "subject" => { from: ["subject"], parsed: true },
      "title" => { from: ["title"] },
      "resource_type" => { from: ["type"], parsed: true },
      "remote_files" => { from: ["thumbnail_url"], parsed: true }
    }
  }
end
```

## Configuring Import Work Types

An Import needs to know what Work Type to create. The importer looks for:

1) An incoming metadata field mapped to 'model'
2) An incoming metadata field mapped to 'work_type'

If it does not find either of these, or the data they contain is not a valid Work Type in the repository, the `default_work_type` will be used.

The install generator sets `default_work_type` to the first Work Type returned by `Hyrax.config.curation_concerns` but this can be overriden by setting `default_work_type` in `config/initializer/bulkrax.rb` as shown above.

## Configuring Field Mapping

It's unlikely that the incoming import data has fields that exactly match those in your repository. Field mappings allow you to tell bulkrax how to map field in the incoming data to a field in your application.

By default, a mapping for the OAI parser has been added to map standard oai_dc fields to Hyrax basic_metadata. The other parsers have no default mapping, and will map any incoming fields to Hyrax properties with the same name. Configurations can be added in `config/intializers/bulkrax.rb`

Configuring field mappings is documented in the [Bulkrax Configuration Guide](https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax/wiki/Configuration).

## Importing Files

* The BagIt Parser will import files in the data folder of the bag.
* The CSV folder will import files in columns named file (located local to the import csv file in a folder called files) or remote_files (where urls are supplied).
* The OAI parser will import a thumbnail_url specified during import. Pattern matching is supported.
* The XML Parser is not configured to import files by default. To configure URL import, map an incoming element to the remote_files Hyrax property. To map local files for import, we suggest utilizing the `HasLocalProcessing` class injected by the generator.

For example:

```
module Bulkrax::HasLocalProcessing
  def add_local
    parsed_metadata['file'] = image_paths
  end

  # Files are in a folder called files, relative to the import file
  #  with a sub-folder that matches the system_identifier_field
  def image_paths
    import_path = importerexporter.parser_fields['import_file_path']
    import_path = File.dirname(import_path) if File.file?(import_path)
    real_path = File.join(import_path, 'files', "#{parsed_metadata[Bulkrax.system_identifier_field].first}")
    Dir.glob(real_path)
  end
end

```

## Customizing Bulkrax

For further information on how to extend and customize Bulkrax, please see the [Bulkrax Customization Guide](https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax/wiki/Customizing).

## How it Works
Once you have Bulkrax installed, you will have access to an easy to use interface with which you are able to create, edit, delete, run, and re-run imports and exports.

Imports can be scheduled to run once or on a daily, monthly or yearly interval.

Import and export is available to admins via the Importers tab on the dashboard. Export currently supports CSV only.

### View List of Importers
From the admin dashboard, select the "Importers" tab. You will see a list of previously created importers with details of last run, next run, number of records enqueued and processed, failures, deleted upstream records, and total records. From this page you can create a new importer, edit an importer or delete an importer.

### View List of Exporters
From the admin dashboard, select the "Exporters" tab. You will see a list of previously created exporters with details of last run, number of records enqueued and processed, failures, deleted upstream records, and total records. From this page you can create a new exporter, edit an exporter or delete an exporter.

### Create an Importer or Exporter
To create a new importer, select the "New" button on the Importers or Exporters page and complete the form. Name and, for Importer, Administrative set are required. When you select a parser, you will see a set of specific fields to complete.

### Edit an Importer or Exporter
To edit an importer or exporter, select the edit icon (pencil) and complete the form.

### Delete and Importer or Exporter
To delete an importer or exporter, select the delete (x) icon.

### Downloading an export
Once your the exporter has run, a download icon will apear on the exporters menu page.

# Why Samvera and not Hyrax?  Because there are folks creating non-Hyrax applications that will
# almost certainly want to leverage this work.  And there might be switches for `defined?(Hyrax)`.
#
# Further the following four gems have interest in the interfaces of this module:
#
# - Hyrax
# - Hydra::Derivatives
# - Bulkrax
# - IiifPrint
#
# As such, it makes some sense to isolate the module and begin defining interfaces.
module Samvera
  ##
  # This module separates the finding/creation of a derivative binary (via {FileLocator}) and
  # applying that derivative to the FileSet (via {FileApplicator}).
  #
  # In working on the interface and objects there is an effort to preserve backwards functionality
  # while also allowing for a move away from that functionality.
  #
  # There are three primary concepts to consider:
  #
  # - Locator :: responsible for knowing where the derivative is
  # - Location :: responsible for encapsulating the location
  # - Applicator :: responsible for applying the located derivative to the FileSet
  #
  # The "trick" in this is in the polymorphism of the Location.  Let's say we have the following
  # desired functionality for the thumbnail derivative:
  #
  #   ```gherkin
  #   Given a FileSet
  #   When I provide a thumbnail derivative
  #   Then I want to add that as the thumbnail for the FileSet
  #
  #   Given a FileSet
  #   When I do not provide a thumbnail derivative
  #   Then I want to generate a thumbnail
  #     And add the generated as the thumbnail for the FileSet
  #   ```
  #
  # In the above case we would have two Locator strategies:
  #
  # - Find Existing One
  # - Will Generate One (e.g. Hyrax::FileSetDerivativeService with Hydra::Derivative behavior)
  #
  # And we would have two Applicator strategies:
  #
  # - Apply an Existing One
  # - Generate One and Apply (e.g. Hyrax::FileSetDerivativeService with Hydra::Derivative behavior)
  #
  # The Location from the first successful Locator will dictate how the ApplicatorStrategies do
  # their work.

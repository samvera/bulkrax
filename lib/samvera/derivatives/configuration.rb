    ##
    # The purpose of this class is to contain the explicit derivative generation directives for the
    # upstream application.
    #
    # @note The implicit deriviate types for Hyrax are as follows:
    #       - type :extracted_text with sources [:pdf, :office_document]
    #       - type :thumbnail with sources [:pdf, :office_document, :thumbnail, :image]
    #       - type :mp3 with sources [:audio]
    #       - type :ogg with sources [:audio]
    #       - type :webm with sources [:video]
    #       - type :mp4 with sources [:video]
    #
    # @note A long-standing practice of Samvera's Hyrax has been to have assumptive and implicit
    #       derivative generation (see Hyrax::FileSetDerivativeService).  In being implicit, a
    #       challenge arises, namely overriding and configuring.  There exists a crease in the code
    #       to allow for a different derivative approach (see Hyrax::DerivativeService).  Yet that
    #       approach continues the tradition of implicit work.

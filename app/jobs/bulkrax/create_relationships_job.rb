module Bulkrax
  # Responsible for creating parent-child relationships between Works and Collections.
  #
  # Handles three kinds of relationships:
  # - Work to Collection
  # - Collection to Collection
  # - Work to Work
  #
  # These can be established from either side of the relationship (i.e. from parent to child or from child to parent).
  # This job only creates one relationship at a time. If a record needs multiple parents or children or both, individual
  # jobs should be run for each of those relationships.
  #
  # NOTE: In the context of this job, "record" is used to generically refer
  #       to either an instance of a Work or an instance of a Collection.
  # NOTE: In the context of this job, "identifier" is used to generically refer
  #       to either a record's ID or an Bulkrax::Entry's source_identifier.
  class CreateRelationshipsJob < ApplicationJob
    ##
    # @api public
    # @since v5.0.1
    #
    # Once we've created the relationships, should we then index the works's file_sets to ensure
    # that we have the proper indexed values.  This can help set things like `is_page_of_ssim` for
    # IIIF manifest and search results of file sets.
    #
    # @note As of v5.0.1 the default behavior is to not perform this.  That preserves past
    #       implementations.  However, we might determine that we want to change the default
    #       behavior.  Which would likely mean a major version change.
    #
    # @example
    #   # In config/initializers/bulkrax.rb
    #   Bulkrax::CreateRelationshipsJob.update_child_records_works_file_sets = true
    #
    # @see https://github.com/scientist-softserv/louisville-hyku/commit/128a9ef

    # The entry_identifier is used to lookup the @base_entry for the job (a.k.a. the entry the job was called from).
    # The @base_entry defines the context of the relationship (e.g. "this entry (@base_entry) should have a parent").
    # Whether the @base_entry is the parent or the child in the relationship is determined by the presence of a
    # parent_identifier or child_identifier param. For example, if a parent_identifier is passed, we know @base_entry
    # is the child in the relationship, and vice versa if a child_identifier is passed.
